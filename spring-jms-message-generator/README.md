Spring-JMS-Message-Generator
=================

A simple app using Spring Boot and Spring JMS to send JMS messages on a schedule (in essence a JMS event generator)
Application has been tested with [SoftwareAG's Terracotta Universal Messaging, http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/terracotta/in-memory_data_mgmt/products/universal_messaging/overview/default.asp] broker, but should work with any other JMS broker out there.
