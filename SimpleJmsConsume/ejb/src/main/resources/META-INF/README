The J2EE resources are actually in ${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF/j2ee_templates/

Explanation:

We need to change the J2EE descriptors based on value of build property "Consumer.Env.jmsMessageEnableReply".
So we use a maven ant task to copy the right resource based on that property value.
